    "This particular Notebook is your trusty St. Bernard rescue dog 🐶, created to ensure you're equipped to scale these heights and able to run Notebooks correctly in either the **Google Colab** environment or the **Binder Cloud** environment.\n",

    "And don't worry - carrying out this test is easier than perfecting your fondue recipe and should only take a minute of your time! 🕐\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's dive in! Follow the steps below to run the `Code Cell`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click into the cell to select it, as if you were pointing out the best Swiss chocolate in a store. 🍫\n",
    "2. To set off on our coding journey, you can either:\n",
    "   - Click the `Play` button, at the top of the screen, depending on the environment you are using.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, if you prefer the scenic route, you can use the keyboard shortcut `shift` + `enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Executing the cell will run the code it contains and print out the result of a \"highly complicated\" mathematical equation. It's as exciting as the moment your raclette cheese starts bubbling! 🧀 You'll know you're all set to embark on our coding adventure if you get the correct result. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** The correct answer is *44*. So, if you see *44* after running the cell, you're ready to go! 🥾 🏔️\n",
    "\n",
    "So strap on your metaphorical hiking boots, and let's embark on our coding adventure together! Enjoy the journey into the enchanting Swiss Alps of Deep Learning!"
