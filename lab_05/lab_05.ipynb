In this lab, we will learn how to enhance vanilla **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** using `PyTorch` to classify even more complex images. We will explore a special type of deep neural network known as **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to achieve this. CNNs leverage the hierarchical pattern in data, allowing them to assemble more complex patterns from smaller, simpler ones. This hierarchical structure enables CNNs to learn a set of discriminative features and subsequently utilize these learned patterns to classify the content of an image."
